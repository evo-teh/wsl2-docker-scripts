# wsl2-docker-scripts
Useful scripts for running docker containers in WSL2 under Windows 10. Avoid installing programs that are only run occasionally and introduce the clutter on the host OS. Run them with the docker instead. Use the scripts in this repository to do so.

## Information

`/compose/win/*` folder contains docker compose files with hardcoded mount volumes. If folder for volumes does not exist it will be created automatically.

`/scripts/win/*` folder contains scripts to run docker compose. Every program is separated. You can add this folder to Environment variables and run them from command line.

## Helper scripts

Add a folder to environment variables:
```powershell
$env:Path += ";c:\scripts\win\"
```

Run the mysql database example:
```powershell
❯ mysql
Starting mysql ... done
Attaching to mysql
